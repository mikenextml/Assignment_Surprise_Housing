# Assignment: Price Prediction: Surprise Housing
Surprise Housing, a US-based firm that leverages data analytics to profitably flip real estate, is keen to penetrate the Australian market. They have assembled a dataset of Australian housing sales, encapsulated in the given CSV file, to aid their venture.

The task is to construct a regularized regression model with this data. The model will predict the actual value of potential properties, thereby guiding the company's investment decisions.

The core objectives of the problem are two-fold:

Identify which variables are significant in forecasting a house's price.
Determine the extent to which these significant variables can accurately predict a house's price.

## General Information

Background of the project

The primary business objective is to develop a model that predicts house prices using available independent variables. This predictive model will enable the organization to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between house prices and the influencing variables. With this insight, strategic adjustments can be made to focus on high-yielding areas, thus optimizing returns. Furthermore, this model will serve as an effective tool for the management to grasp the pricing dynamics within a new market.

## Conclusions

Upon examination of key variables influencing housing prices, our model reveals significant factors as follows:

Material and Finish Quality (OverallQual_9, OverallQual_10, OverallQual_8): Properties that boast superior material and finish quality demand higher prices.

Living Area Square Feet (GrLivArea): Larger living areas above the ground level contribute to a house's increased value.

Exterior Covering (Exterior1st_BrkFace): Houses featuring a brick face exterior cover generally yield higher prices.

Home Functionality (Functional_Typ): Homes with standard or typical functionality tend to have a higher market value.

Overall House Condition (OverallCond_9): A high overall condition rating positively correlates with a higher house price.

Physical Location (Neighborhood_StoneBr, Neighborhood_NridgHt, Neighborhood_Crawfor): Properties located in the neighborhoods of Stone Brook, Northridge Heights, and Crawford typically command high prices.

Type of Sale (SaleType_New): New sale homes tend to fetch higher prices in the market.

Zoning Classification (MSZoning_FV): Houses with a floating village residential zoning classification are associated with a higher sale price.

In conclusion, these variables significantly impact the house pricing, suggesting that prospective investors should consider them when making purchasing decisions.
